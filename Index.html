                          <p class="lead">
                            during the summer months of 2013, I was taken on as a Software Development Intern by <a href="http://guidewire.com">Guidewire software, Inc.</a> I was afforded the opportunity to develope my software development skills and employ any theoretical knowledge acquired throughout my time at <a href="#ITT">IT Tallaght</a> and become familliar with many industry standard technologies and tools.
                          </p><p>
                          In particular, I gained some valuable experience with Agile methodologies (Kanban specifically), Unit Testing, Maven, Git and GitHub, Python, Gosu, Documentation, the JVM, Compilation, Parsing, Syntax Trees, Heap and Stack memory, Garbage Collection, Profiling, Presentations, Demos and Guidewire Products.
                        </p><p>
                        As I was part of the first group of EMEA interns taken on by Guidewire, I was asked to document my experience in the form of a blog post towards the end of my time with the company. This post can be seen here:

                          Having been interested in the start-up culture, and attending start-up events like 'Dubstarts' in the past. It was when Chad and Scott from Guidewire first described the company culture in these terms at a milk round in my college that my attention was piqued and I first became interested in, and indeed aware of, Guidewire. It wasn't long before I heard back to my application, and interviews and code tests followed soon after.

                        Each of us had our own mentor assigned to us, someone we could approach with questions or difficulties should we need to. It was always nice to have someone to go to, but we found that everyone in the office was always happy to help or offer advice, sticking to their core principal of Collegiality. The company has 3 core principals of Rationality, Collegiality and Integrity, and working here, you really see that they stick to them.

                      Our first days of the internship were spent getting ourselves set up, installing what we needed and taking crash courses in different areas from the EDC team. Some of these topics included Agile, Unit Testing, Maven, Git and GitHub, Documentation, Guidewire Products and Gosu (Their in-house, but now open-source development language). By the end of our first week we were set up and had already begun our first project, benchmarking the Gosu language.
                    </p><p>
                    This project had us translating algorithms into Gosu and performing analysis on the runtime stats we collected. We were comparing these with other languages, primarily Java. 
                  </p><p>
                  Over the next 6 weeks we were able to get a taste for and use a lot of different technologies and languages; Scripting in python, Gosu, benchmarks, the compilation and parsing process, memory allocation on the heap and subsequent garbage collection, scope, concurrency and profiling tools. We used a python script to run our algorithms in Java and Gosu and collect the runtime statistics. We then compared these with the results we gathered using timestamps in the algorithms and the results from our profiling sessions.
                </p><p>
                This project cumulated in a trip to the Foster City office in California, where we were due to present our findings to the Gosu team, among others. Before we set off, we were given the opportunity to present our project in front of the Dublin office at a BBL session. A BBL (Brown Bag Lunch) is a lunchtime talk held in the office on some particular topic, one thing you notice around Guidewire is everyone is interested and dedicated to on-going learning and self-improvement.
              </p><p>
              Although daunting at first, a genuine interest in the project was expressed by everyone in the room and we were inundated with questions about the project and our results. We were able to take these questions, and better prepare the presentation to include the answers, or to revisit our approach and get extra data we needed in order to provide full answers to these questions for our final presentation in California. 
            </p><p>
            In Foster City we were immersed in the company completely, treated as equals (Back to their 3 core principals!) and welcomed into the office. We attended company meetings, study groups, round tables, picnics, luaus and more while we were there. The trip also served as a catalyst for getting to know our fellow Dubliners better, and getting to know new faces. By the time we arrived in Foster City, we had begun our second project, but continued tweaking the final presentation after meeting with the Gosu team over there. 
          </p><p>
          Looking back on the project now, I can see exactly why this was such a suitable intern project. We took full ownership of it and were able to feel like we were providing useful to the company. We found ourselves exploring details of the JVM and the language itself that we'd never even considered before. We built on top of our existing knowledge and were able to fully understand how code design could affect code performance. Using profilers we were able to actually see how variables were allocated and deallocated on the heap.
        </p><p>
        We started our second project just before we set off for California and spent a lot of the first week or two researching AST Trees, the compilation and parsing process and frameworks like ANTLR. At first there was a pretty steep learning curve, but it was all very interesting stuff. Thankfully, we never needed to implement any of these ourselves.
      </p><p>
      The project was to analyse code files written in Gosu to ensure they adhered to the Guidewire Coding Style Standards with regard to layout and variable naming conventions. Using an AST tree we would be able to visit different nodes and check that it was in line with the conventions. In the end we got access to the AST by using the PSI in IntelliJ.
    </p><p>
    Our project started in earnest while we were in San Francisco. Being on site with the Gosu team sitting beside us was a great help and we were finally able to set off in the right direction. We set up our environments to develop a plugin for IntelliJ itself, with a view to creating additional inspections that could be incorporated into the Gosu plugin for IntelliJ.
  </p><p>
  We quickly learned that this tool was highly sought after across all departments, and we were pretty excited to be developing a tool that would be put to good use around the company and talk of incorporating it into the build process soon cropped up. We were developing something useful and meaningful. 
</p><p>
The tool would highlight sections of the code as the developer typed it where it did not adhere to the standards. After a project based primarily around analysis, it was great to get coding, build something from scratch and see the results of our code running. We were able to implement a number of inspections before we finished our internship, and the project was to be taken on someone else at Guidewire to complete it.
</p><p>
Throughout the 3 months I spent at Guidewire, we were welcome able to attend any of the study groups and presentations that took place in the office regularly. For example, we got involved in a study group that met weekly to discuss 5 topics from '97 things every programmer should know', we joined a group learning session with a number of people who were planning to take the Scrum Master test from scrum.org, we attended a number of BBLs on various topics, attended code reviews and sat in on the EDC daily stand-ups before doing our own stand ups.
</p><p>
Coming away from this internship with a better understanding of the development process is going to be a great asset to me back in college. We used an Agile Methodology throughout our time with Guidewire, reporting our progress at daily scrums, providing estimates, producing incremental results and demonstrating this progress regularly to our mentors and manager. The documentation templates are going to be very useful in the next year at college. Working in an Agile environment after studying the dynamics of it in college really tied everything together.
</p><p>
Another big take away from my internship is, having become familiar with Git over the summer, learning the hard way what to do and what not to do, I've now started using it to control everything I do, even this blog post! 
</p><p>
I had high expectations coming into Guidewire, and all of them were exceeded. The company, the people, the projects and overall environment created a fantastic learning experience. I would not hesitate in recommending an internship here to anyone considering it in the future!
