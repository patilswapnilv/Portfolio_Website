Portfolio Website
Design & develop a webpage showcasing your talents and achievements. This website must be developed using Twitter Bootstrap as a base. Think of the page as your online CV, which you will show potential employers when you near graduation.

In particular:
Develop a single page portfolio
-------------------------------
* All details must be true
* A hero component at the top of the page should include
	*	a photo and details such as your name & discipline
* Write a short note for each section below the hero component
* Any project or CA you are particularly proud of should be included (screenshots are a good idea)
* Computing students must include 2nd, 3rd & 4th year projects
* ITMgmt students must include work placement details
* FLITE students may use their previous work experience
* A section on the type of work or project that you are interested in
* Word count for the page should be at least 1000 words
* Avoid too many sections on your hobbies, one section at the end of the page is best
* Theme and style the page in a professional (employable) way
* A button which opens a modal dialog with contact information for you (when is best to call/email you, how to get in contact)
* You may include JavaScript (JQuery etc.) features if you wish but remember the objective is a well designed portfolio page
* Contain no material that could be deemed defamatory, offensive or in poor taste regarding yourself, your fellow students, the institute or anyone else

Marking

* does it fulfil the criteria established above
* is it usable & legible on mobile, tablet and desktop devices?
